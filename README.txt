The actual runnable .JAR can be found in the demo/ folder.

Important note:
To control the velocity of the cannon-ball, the player must PRESS AND HOLD the space bar.
The DURATION for which is it held determines the velocity (and not the left/right arrows).
This makes the gameplay more challenging!

Further notes:
- Please read the different options of keys to press in the upper-left corner of the executable.
- The physics simulation is entirely done with verlet integration and hard constraints.
- The effect of the wind force is subtle but can be clearly seen if one shoots straight up.
- I have implemented the bonus 'conservation of momentum'.
